					</h2>
				</header>
					<div class="box alt container">
							<p>Find the start of Lade Braes on South Street (the alleyway going down to Regs) and just follow it right down to DRA and circle round back past Hepburn Gardens, you'll have finished 4km whilst spanning some good path running. On a nice day you'll have the sun coming down past the Lade Braes stream, down an easy terrain and no chance of getting too lost.</p>

							<p>If competitive, or group running is more your thing be sure to check out the weekly timed parkrun in Craigtoun country park. A little bit out of town, but sure to blow away to cobwebs on a Suaturday morning and meet some faces others than those of students</p>

					</h2>
				</header>
					<div class="box alt container">
							<p>However, if you'd prefer a more local 5k try the scenic and simple run along Canongate. Still taking you a little out of St Andrews, allowing minimal traffic but still staying within St Andrews boundaries</p>

							<p>Want to get longer distances under your belt? There and back running to Leuchars is just over a half marathon. Good to mimic a typical road race with safe cycle paths the whole way, this track will get those legs going.</p>
